# Lab 06 - Implement Traffic Management
# Lab scenario

You were tasked with testing managing network traffic targeting Azure virtual machines in the hub and 
spoke network topology, which Contoso considers implementing in its Azure environment (instead of 
creating the mesh topology, which you tested in the previous lab). This testing needs to include implementing connectivity between spokes by relying on user defined routes that force traffic to flow via the 
hub, as well as traffic distribution across virtual machines by using layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers. For 
this purpose, you intend to use Azure Load Balancer (layer 4) and Azure Application Gateway (layer 7).
